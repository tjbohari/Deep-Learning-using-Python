# Neural Network implementation from scratch

Implementation of Logistic Regression (using neural network approach), shallow neural network and optimizations such as momentum with backpropogation. This project is developed 
from scratch using numpy without using any libraries such as tensorflow or pytorch. The implementation is evaluated using the *CIFAR10* dataset and other datasets.

## Dependencies
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
